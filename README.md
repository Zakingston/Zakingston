Welcome!!

😎 My name is Ezequiel Ortega, and this is the place where I leave my projects. Some of them are from the Big Data & Data Science Master that I am currently enrolled in, while others are personal projects where I collected data from Kaggle most of the time. The goal of these projects is to practice everything I've learned and continuously improve my knowledge. The most important aspect here is to materialize my progress.

🧠 I love working with datasets, analyzing them, and utilizing machine learning to predict various outcomes based on the data.

👍 Please feel free to provide any kind of feedback as it will greatly assist me in my learning journey.

📧 You can reach out to me on LinkedIn: Ezequiel Ortega Palomino.

Thank you very much!!
